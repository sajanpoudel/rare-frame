          <p className="mb-4">
            RARE EVO 2025 utilizes blockchain technology for NFT tickets. Due to the nature of blockchain technology, certain information related to your NFT tickets (such as wallet addresses and transaction details) is stored on public blockchains (including Base Network) and is inherently public and transparent.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            When you mint an NFT ticket (GA, VIP, or WHALE PASS), transaction information is recorded on the blockchain. This information is immutable and cannot be deleted. However, personal information associated with ticket registration is stored off-chain in our secure databases.
          </p>
          <p>
            NFT ticket holders may receive exclusive benefits including entry to special events, merchandise, and other perks as described in our ticket offerings. Your participation in these activities may involve processing additional personal information.
